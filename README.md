Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the developmentand maintainance of high- quality software systems.
Importance: - It enables creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life such as entertainment, healthcare, communication and commerce.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Development of programming Languages
- Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960
- Rise of agile methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
- Design: Writing code and building the software architecture and user interface
- Implementation: Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
- Deployment: Releasing the software to users and customers
- Maintainance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall: Sequential approach with distinct phases(e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall. May be used in short- term projects with minimal scope change.
- Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. May be used in dynamic projects that changes are expected to occure.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
-Quality Assurance Engineer: E nsure software quality by designing and executing test plans.
-Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provie a comprehensive set of toolsin a single application, which include code editor, compiler or interpreter, debugger and often other tools like graphical user interface(GUI)
builder. It makes developers to work more efficiently. Example include Visual Studio Code, Pycharm
VCS allow multiple developers to work the same codebase simultaniously. Example is Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Tight details which pressure the delivery of projects on schedule cause rushed development and compromised quality.
- Changing requirements which can lead to scope creep and project delays
- Technical debt which are accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions and may impede future development efforts and increase maintainance cost.
- Strategies for overcoming challenges include: - effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing: Testing individual components or modules of of software
Intergration: Testing interaction between different components or subsystems.
System testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole
Acceptance testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance: Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing and continuous intergration help identify and fix defects early in evelopment stages leading to higher- quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
This is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible response from AI models
It is important because it helps making the questions or statement clear and specific so that the AI understands what you need

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-Vague prompt-"Tell me about oranges?"
- Improved prompt- "How are oranges planted and harvested?"
It is more focused on the methods of farming and harvesting Oranges than the vague prompt which may just give a general knowldege of Oranges
